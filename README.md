# 🚦 Intelligent Traffic Signal Control System

An AI-powered traffic management system designed to optimize urban traffic flow using real-time data, computer vision, and machine learning. The system dynamically adjusts signal timings, prioritizes emergency vehicles, and provides analytics for smart city planning.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Urban traffic congestion causes:
- Long waiting times at intersections  
- Fuel wastage and higher emissions  
- Delays in emergency response  

Traditional fixed-timer signals cannot adapt to real-time traffic conditions.
